      <description>Preface It is considered to be important to have an overview of Operating Systems. However, due to my laziness and the radio-building-oriented subject I major in, I hardly complete any courses about OSs.
After the spring festival, feeling still knowing little about OS and losing ability on computer programming, I picked up xv6 labs from MIT 6.S081 courses again, hoping by coping with them will be of help.
The hardest thing I came up with is not What to do but How to do and Why doing so works.</description>
